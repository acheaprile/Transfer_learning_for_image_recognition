# Transfer Learning for Image recognition
A ML model for image recognition using transfer learning.

## General info
The aim of this project was to create a simple image recognition model using the weights of a pre-trained model (using weights learned on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) for this specific example). This specific model is composed of a pre-trained model and a model on top of it composed by six Dense layers, which five of them use a Relu function as the activation function and the last one uses a Softmax activaction function in order to assign
