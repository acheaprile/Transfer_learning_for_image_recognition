# Transfer Learning for Image recognition
A ML model for image recognition using transfer learning.

## General info
The aim of this repository was to create a simple image recognition model using the weights of a pre-trained model (using weights learned on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) for this specific example). This model is composed of a pre-trained model and a model on top of it composed by six Dense layers. Five of these layers use a Relu function as their activation function and the last one uses a Softmax as activaction function in order to assign probabilities to the model output.
